## Unit Aware User Defined Functions

Include the appropriate reference worksheet in your own **Mathcad Prime** (RefProp_units.mcdx) or **Mathcad 15** (RefProp_units.xmcd) worksheets to provide user-defined function wrappers for all of the **NIST RefProp Add-in** function calls and more.  View these files in Mathcad Prime (.mcdx) or Mathcad 15 (.xmcd) to see all of the functions available.  They are also listed in the Mathcad 15 Handbook (e-Book) and Appendix C of the User Guid PDF under PrimeDocs.
